This file is a reminder that src/particle_system.cu should be DELETED.

It has been replaced by:
- src/particle_kernels.cu (CUDA device code)
- src/particle_system.cpp (OpenGL host code)

The CMakeLists.txt filters out particle_system.cu, but you should delete it manually for cleanliness.

To delete:
  Windows PowerShell: Remove-Item src\particle_system.cu
  Windows CMD:        del src\particle_system.cu
  Linux/Mac:          rm src/particle_system.cu
